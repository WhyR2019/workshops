# High Performance Programming Tools with R (NVIDIA graphic cards needed)

Authors: Erin	Hodgess, [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/)

### Description

In this workshop, we will explore some high performance computing (HPC) tools in conjunction with R.  Workshop participants will learn to write and compile Fortran subroutines to utilize basic OpenACC directives, the message passing interface (MPI), and if time permits, CUDA Fortran, via the Portland Group, Inc (PGI) community edition compiler.  We will demonstrate how to produce R functions to call these subroutines.  Finally, we will run a simulation study to compare performance times against existing serial functions.

*Note:  All participants need the latest version of the PGI community edition installed, along with an NVIDIA graphics card.  Windows users must have Rtools installed.*
