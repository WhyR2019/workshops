Authors: Radmila 	Velichkovich, [University of Neuchatel](https://www.unine.ch/)

### Description

Connecting two or more datasets which do not contain the same ID or ID named differently can be a challenging task. R provides several packages that help dealing with the challenge of fusing the data. 
The workshop will cover the theoretical part on data integration process with focus on data matching (and deduplication) on example datasets as well as to real world dataset. 

Various R packages that support data linkage will be explained.
