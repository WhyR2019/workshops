# Speeding up R wih C++ (Rcpp) - from basics to more advanced applications

### Description

Typical bottlenecks of programs in R are (1) loops that can not easily be vectorized, because   calculations in a given iteration depend on the results from the previous iterations; (2) recursive functions or problems that require multiple calling the same function.
C++ can help to solve these problems. It is a modern, fast and very well supported programming language with numerous additional libraries allowing to perform various types of computational tasks.

Thanks to the Rcpp package written by Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois combining C++ with R is very easy.
Various aspects of C++ and Rcpp will be discussed starting from simple examples that will help you easily replace the R code with often significantly faster counterparts in C++.

An earlier knowledge of C++ is NOT required, but it will probably be helpful.

The use of C++ in R requires installation of a C++ compiler.

To make it available, please:
- on Windows: install the latest version of Rtools.
- on Mac: install the Xcode application from the AppStore
- on Linux: sudo apt-get install r-base-dev or similar.

Workshop participants are kindly requested to install the newest version of Rtools (or equivalent - see above) and Rcpp package on their computers BEFORE the workshop

Prior to the installation of above packages it is also recommended:
install.packages(c("devtools", "usethis", "installr", "Rcpp", "RcppArmadillo", "RcppNumerical", "rbenchmark"))
