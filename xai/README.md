### Description

Explainable AI (XAI) is a scorching topic in prediction modelling and business process intelligence. Machine Learning algorithms have been used more and more in business decision processes. The principal problem is that most of them are so called “Black boxes”.  The name “Black box” depicts challenges in model understanding. Decision makers want to recognize the underlying logic of model reasoning as it has to be explained to stakeholders. XAI is a possible solution for understanding “Black-box” model complexity and fuzziness. We will present use cases of applied XAI, namely for X-sell Marketing Campaigns and Risk Management cases. 

We will show how XAI helps in stability & sensitivity analysis, prediction quality assessment and identification of decision drivers. Based on our analysis it can be stated that XAI is a set of solutions enabling application of “Black box” models in many business industries through in-depth understanding of advanced Machine Learning modelling.
