### Description

The workshop will be split into two parts.

The first part will introduce the new [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/) package framework.
_mlr3_ is the successor of the [mlr](https://mlr.mlr-org.com/) package.
We'll give a overview and walk you through some basic examples.

The second part starts with a brief overview of the [drake](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/) package in R.
This package helps you to set up a reproducible workflow of your project.
It integrates greatly with the _mlr3_ package.
We'll give examples on different complexity levels and walk you through these.
