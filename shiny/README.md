# Shiny Basics

Authors: Theo	Roe, [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/)

### Description

A quick introduction to creating interactive visualisations of data using shiny. The workshop will first make sure everyone is familiar with rmarkdown and htmlwidgets for creating a document with nice visualisations. We will then extend this knowledge by examining the shiny package for creating input output bindings to interaction with our R data structures. We will cover the basics of input and output for a shiny application and then explore creating our own page layouts. By the end of the workshop participants should feel comfortable getting started with creating their own shiny applications.
